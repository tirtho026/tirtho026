🌱 I’m currently exploring:
- 🔧 Robotics projects with Arduino and ESP32
- 🐍 Python for automation and data processing
- 📡 IoT concepts with sensors and wireless modules
- 🤖 Obstacle-avoiding robots, smart sensors & more

📚 I’ve worked with:
- Programming: C, C++, Python (beginner), MATLAB
- Microcontrollers: Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega, ESP32, ESP32-S3
- Sensors: DHT11, BMP180, IR sensors, ultrasonic, gyroscope
- Tools: CodeBlocks, PyCharm, Arduino IDE, Tinkercad, VS Code

💻 Favorite project so far: **ShieldBot** – a multi-sensor robot for safety and smart home applications.

🔭 Currently learning:
- 🐧 Linux Ubuntu (daily use)
- 🤖 ROS (planned soon!)
- 🔬 Real-time object detection using Blynk + ultrasonic + servo

📦 Some of my GitHub repos will include:
- Simulations built in Tinkercad
- Sensor test codes and mini projects
- Wiring diagrams and real-world hardware tests
- Future drone development work!

📌 Fun Fact: I love combining sensors with creative ideas to solve real problems — whether it’s for a smart home, a weather bot, or a fire safety alarm.  
Let’s build something awesome together 🚀
